Would you like me to integrate it directly into your cleaned-up README so it‚Äôs fully formatted and consistent with the rest of the markdown (so you can copy it all at once)?


## üéµ How to Extract Music from *The Sims 4*, *3*, and *Medieval* (and possibly The Sims + The Sims 2)

Follow these steps to extract in-game music and soundtracks into `.wav` files, ready for conversion.

### Step 1: Install Tools

Download and install **S4PE** and **S3PE**:

* [S4PE (The Sims 4 Package Editor)](https://github.com/s4ptacle/Sims4Tools/releases)
* [S3PE (The Sims 3 Package Editor)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sims3tools/files/s3pe/14-0222-1852/s3pe_14-0222-1852.7z/download)

### Step 2: Locate and Extract `_AUD` Files

#### For *The Sims 4*

1. Open **s4pe.exe** ‚Üí **File > Open** ‚Üí select your *The Sims 4* installation folder.
2. Audio files are stored in:

   * Base game: `..\The Sims 4\Data\Client\`
   * Expansion/Stuff packs: `..\The Sims 4\EP(SP)XX\`
   * Common audio packages:
     `ClientFullBuild1`, `ClientFullBuild2`, `ClientFullBuild3`, `ClientFullBuild4`, `ClientFullBuild5`, `ClientDeltaBuild1`, `ClientDeltaBuild2`, `ClientDeltaBuild3`, `ClientDeltaBuild4`, `ClientDeltaBuild5`
3. Filter only audio files:

   * In the filter section, enter `_AUD` in the **Tag** field, check **Tag** and **Filter Active**, then click **Set**.
4. Sort by size:

   * Click the **Memsize** column header **twice** to sort files from largest to smallest.
5. Select `.sns` files (they contain actual audio data).
6. Right-click ‚Üí **Export > To file‚Ä¶** and extract them into the **Decoder** folder or the **Work** folder (recommended).

---

#### For *The Sims 3* & *The Sims Medieval*

Follow the same extraction steps using **s3pe.exe**.

* Base game files: `..\The Sims 3\GameData\Shared\Packages\`
* Expansions & Stuff Packs: `..\The Sims 3\EPX(SP)XX\GameData\Shared\Packages\`
* Look for files named `FullBuild_XX.package` or `DeltaBuild_XX.package`.

#### For *The Sims* & *The Sims 2*
Not yet tested but I feel like extracted audio's can be converted with the steps below, if not, use [vgstream](https://vgmstream.org/)

### Step 3: Decode `.SNS` Files

1. Place all extracted `.sns` files in the **Work** folder.
2. Run `DecodeAudio.bat`.
3. Wait for decoding to complete.
4. Press **Y** to open the decoded audio folder or **N** to close.

Your decoded audio is now in **.WAV** format ‚Äî note that WAV files are large and may have compatibility issues.

---

### Step 4: Convert Decoded Audio

1. Run `ConvertAudio.bat`.
2. Choose your desired output: **FLAC**, **M4A**, or **both**.
3. Converted files are saved in:

   ```
   ..\ConvertedAudio\FLAC\
   ..\ConvertedAudio\M4A\
   ```
4. Existing files are skipped automatically.

---

### Step 5: Identify and Tag Your Audio

Decoded files do **not** include metadata.
You may need to compare and listem audio with the radio stations inside The Sims (Open Settings ‚Üí Music ‚Üí Select Genre & Listen)
You can use a tag editor such as [Mp3tag](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/download.html) to add:

* Title, Artist, Album, Composer, BPM, etc.

After tagging, your audio files will be ready for playback with most media players.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Summary

1. Place your `.sns`, `.snr`, or `.vid` files in the **Work** folder.
2. Run **DecodeAudio.bat** to decode them into **DecodedAudio**.
3. Run **ConvertAudio.bat** to convert `.wav` files to FLAC or M4A.
4. Choose the format when prompted.
5. Find converted files in:

   ```
